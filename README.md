## Features

### 1. **Upload and Customize CSV Data**
- **File Upload**: Users can upload CSV files from their local machine.
- **Custom Delimiters**: Choose the appropriate delimiter for your file (e.g., `,`, `;`, `|`).
- **Dynamic Data Parsing**: Automatically detects column names, data types, and other key properties.

### 2. **Dataset Summary**
- **Automatic Summarization**: Generates a detailed JSON summary of the dataset, including:
  - Dataset Name
  - Dataset Description
  - Column Names and Descriptions
  - Sample Data Points
  - Statistical Properties (e.g., mean, median, mode, etc.).
- Provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of the datasetâ€™s structure.

---

### 3. **Goal Generation**
- **Interactive Goal Setting**: Click the "Generate Goals" button to create 5 tailored goals based on the dataset.
- Each goal includes:
  - **Question**: What insight is being sought?
  - **Visualization Type**: Suggested visual (e.g., bar chart, pie chart, line graph).
  - **Rationale**: Why this visualization is relevant to the dataset.

---

### 4. **Visual Generation**
- **Data-Driven Visuals**: Use the generated goals to create beautiful, meaningful visualizations directly from the dataset.

---

### 5. **Natural Language Querying**
- **Query Support**: Ask questions about the dataset in plain English.
  - Example: *"Show me the sales trend over the last 6 months."*
- **AI-Powered Visualization**: Translates queries into corresponding visualizations without requiring any coding.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/safiullah-arian/Visualizations-using-Natural-Language.git
   cd Visualizations-using-Natural-Language
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```bash
     touch .env
     ```
   - Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following keys:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key_here>
     GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_api_key_here>
     ```
   - Replace `<your_google_api_key_here>` and `<your_groq_api_key_here>` with your actual API keys, depending on which model you want to use. 
      You can also change the models in ```AgentBuilder.py``` and ```GoalGenerator.py``` files.

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   cd app
   streamlit run nl_Visuals.py
   ```

5. **Access the App**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.
